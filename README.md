## Datasets Preparation

Download validation set [data set ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IbD_zl5MecMCEj6ozGh40FE5u-MaxPLh/view?usp=sharing) It should look like this: 
```

${PROJECT_ROOT}
 -- val       
     -- road_anomaly
         ...
     -- segment_me
         ...
```
Download [train set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k25FpVP4pG3ER3eXsR-go_iprZMEdEae/view?usp=sharing).It should look like this: 
```
 -- train_dataset
     -- offline_dataset
         ...
     -- offline_dataset_score
         ...
     -- offline_dataset_score_view
         ...
     -- ood.json
```
Due to our use of [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) as our foundation framework, only minimal modifications were required. 
In this section, we will outline the specific file changes we made to implement our approach.
